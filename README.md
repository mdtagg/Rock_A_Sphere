## About

This app was created with the goal of distributing weather information to climbing community. Certain types of rocks become more fragile after a rain 
which can lead to both dangerous situations for the climber and also lead to permanent damage of the rock. The information in this app can be used as
a reference to make more informed decisions about when to climb after and rain as well as information about what kinds of rock are found in any given area.
